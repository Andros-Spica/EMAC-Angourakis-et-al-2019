**Abstract**  
Several analytical techniques are potential data sources for characterizing archaeological ceramics. Each technique returns information that is significantly different, though partially overlapping. Unfortunately, it is not so common for studies to integrate the results of more than one analytical technique and, when they do, it is often through textual description and argument rather than statistics. As suggested by several authors in the past, including Mike Baxter, the lack of integration through quantitative methods is an obstacle for more informative data analyses, the comparability of datasets, and reproducibility.
To help to overcome this problem, we defined four protocols for multivariate analysis of ceramics, each covering different types of input data. Protocols 1 and 2 guide, separately, the analysis of geochemical compositions (e.g., XRF) and petrographic observations through thin-section Optical Microscopy. Protocols 3 and 4 are two varieties of a hybrid or ‘mixed-mode’ approach that integrates the geochemical and petrographic data, returning a general picture of the diversity of materials. Acknowledging the diversity within the field, we propose these protocols not as fixed recipes, but as frameworks to perform and compare different analytical strategies.
All four protocols were made available as a package in R (cerUB), which is free and open-source. This presentation will focus on demonstrating the four protocols, and explore their possibilities, using the open dataset included in the package (‘Wine Roman amphorae from Catalonia, NE Spain’). A more detailed demonstration can be found in our online tutorial (https://andros-spica.github.io/cerUB_tutorial/).
